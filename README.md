# Local Event Website

The goals for this website are to increase local engagement with events, increase user retention by consistently offering value to users in the form of new content, offers and events. Increase exposure for acts we are collaborating with and to increase the area of our customer base.

Our call to action will be to "Book Now", users will be lead there through an easy-to-use, aesthetically pleasing and non-cluttered website adverting the biggest events as a priority and scaling down; making sure to only include relevent information.
